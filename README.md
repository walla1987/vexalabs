### Setting Up Project Locally 

A Docker environment was setup to create a uniform environment for developers.

- Clone the repository.
- Copy .env.example to .env within root directory
- set QUEUE_CONNECTION=database AND DB_HOST=mysql within the newly created .env file
- Run docker compose up --build -d
- Access application using http://localhost

### Running migrations

### Queue worker
